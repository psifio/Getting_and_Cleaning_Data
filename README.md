Getting and Cleaning Data with R Course Project


This is aa repository for the final peer assesment project of coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data with R Course Project"

The repo contains three files
1)Readme.md: (this file)
2) run_analysis.R:
An R script that loads wearable computing data from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
The script does the following:
 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

3) CodeBook.md:
This file describes the variables, the data, and the transformations  to clean up the data 

The origianl dataset can be downloaded from:
